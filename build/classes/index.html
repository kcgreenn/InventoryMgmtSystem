                    <p>One of the errors that I encountered during development of this application, was where an error message was displayed when tabbing between text fields.
                        This triggered the incorrect data type error, even though nothing was actually typed by the user. To solve this problem, I wrote and if statement to check if 
                        the user had entered at least one character. If they had only tabbed into the text field, than it would no longer display the error message.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>A feature that I would like to implement in an updated version of this application would be database connectivity. 
                        This would enable the data to persist after exiting the application, be shared between different user, and allow far more data to be stored efficiently.</p>
